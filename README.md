# ScalaCoursera

This repository contains the code for Coursera's [Functional Programming Principles in Scala][01] course given by Martin Odersky, creator of Scala. It contains some other ideas of my own though, so it really can't be considered a true repository of that course.

If you find this repository useful you'll probably will also be interested in [Notes on Functional Programming Principles in Scala MOOC][02].
